# Serverless Computing
In this document , I talk about serverless computing

In an article titled [What serverless computing really means, and everything else you need to know](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-serverless-computing-really-means-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know/) by Scott Fulton ,serverless architecture is a programming paradigm for cloud platforms that is transforming the way apps are designed, deployed, and ultimately consumed. Serverless helps make it easier for a software developer to write code that will run on a cloud platform and fulfill a certain task.


Over the years, serverless has grown and is been used by several companies since it has a low cost. Moreover , serverless is also easy to deploy. In other words , if you need to get an app up and running quickly, serverless might be the way to go. You may now deploy an app in hours or days rather than weeks or months. The reason for this is that you will not have to worry about infrastructure. You can concentrate on the code and release it right away since scalability is automatic. Serverless is the future indeed!
